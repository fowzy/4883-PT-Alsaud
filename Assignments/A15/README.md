### Description    : 
>My problem for my project and presentation is Egyptian Multiplication which I found really interesting which helps me learned new way that Egyption used to use back in the day. They don't use number and they use to use symbols 'hieroglyphs' also they have no zero, also the way they multiply is attached in a picture called 'EgyptianMultiplication.jpg' and the pdf for this problem mentioned alot of stuff. User put an input in ASCII code and I have to convert or translate the hieroglyphs to integers and then follow the steps for the same method that explained in the pdf or the picture which I used later two pairs of vectors to store my numbers and then get the numbers that adds up to the left side and then add the right side value(right vector value. Remember is pair of vectos (left, right)) and last thing re translate the numbers to hieroglyphs and then sorted and put it in certain format. Unfortenly my answer didn't got accept it because the short of time I have, which all I need to do is format it in certain way and then if the values 10,000 terminate the calculation accoding to the instructions which I forgot to do. My program will calclate whatever amount which is a good thing but is not required in the program.
