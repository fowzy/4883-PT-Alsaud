### Description    :
> So in this assignment I decided to use Python which I know is slower but I just want to see the different and try something different and I did created two lists of integers one in Random Order and one in Descending Order and I did created two lists of float as well and I did attached the comparesion in schuedle and in a chart as you can see.
